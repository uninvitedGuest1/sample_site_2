    Hey guys !!!!
    Don't forget to save and refresh your site everytime you add something new.
    We assign classes to items so that we can style them individually. conversely, we can also use the same class name so that we are able to give the same style to any other item with the same class name

Needless to say, we failed to travel the world on our boat, but got the world to travel to us. Since landing on the island, we've attracted over 30,000 unique visitors and we hope everyone visits this place at least once in their lifetime.</p>
